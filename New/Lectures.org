Language as thought shaper

To quote Alan Perlis: "a language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing."

The goal of a thought shaper language is to change the way a programmer thinks about structuring his or her program. The basic building blocks provided by a programming language, as well as the ways in which they can (or cannot) be combined, will tend to lead programmers down a "path of least resistance", for some unit of resistance. For example, an imperative programming style is definitely the path of least resistance in C. It's possible to write functional C programs, but as C does not make it the path of least resistance, most C programs will not be functional.

Functional programming languages, by the way, are a good example of thought shaper languages. By taking away assignment from the programmer's basic toolbox, the language really forces programmers coming from an imperative language to change their coding habits. I'm not just thinking of purely functional languages like Haskell. Languages like ML and Clojure make functional programming the path of least resistance, yet they don't entirely abolish side-effects. Instead, by merely de-emphasizing them, a program written in these languages can be characterized as a sea of immutability with islands of mutability, as opposed to a sea of mutability with islands of immutability. This subtle shift often makes it vastly easier to reason about the program.

Erlang's concurrency model based on isolated processes communicating by messages is another example of a language design that leads to radically different program structure, when compared to mainstream multithreading models. Dijkstra's "GOTO considered harmful" and Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes are pioneering examples of the use of language design to reshape our thoughts on programming. In a more recent effort, Fortress wants to steer us towards writing parallel(izable) programs by default.

Expanding the analogy with natural languages, languages as thought shapers are not about changing the vocabulary or the grammar, but primarily about changing the concepts that we talk about. Erlang inherits most of its syntax from Prolog, but Erlang's concepts (processes, messages) are vastly different from Prolog's (unification, facts and rules, backtracking). As a programing language researcher, I really am convinced that language shapes thought.

**** Altenative paradigms in the industry:
- "Excell is the most used programming language"
- SQL is mostly functional (relational)
- F# officially supported by MicroSoft
- Exponential growth of Erlang / Haskell

**** Fun reading on the importance of using the right language:

** Outline of the course
*** Brief exposition of each paradigm
- Functional (requirement: "introduction to functional programming" TDA555)
- Imperative (not a requirement: "machine-oriented programming" EDA480)
- Concurrent (not a requirement: "concurrent programming" TDA381)
- Object oriented (requirement: "Object oriented programming" DAT042)
- Logic (not a requirement: ?)
*** (Some) Transformations between paradigms
*** Learning outcomes
**** Awareness of multiple paradigms
First question of the design phase: "How should I think about this
problem?"
**** Recognise "encoded" thoughts:
***** what is the natural paradigm
***** decode them
**** Encode thoughts expressed in a paradigm in another one

**** The exam questions will be similar to exercises
Note in particular that exercises are integral part of the course material.

* Prelude: A crash course on types

Types are essential to get a quick overview of what a program is
"about". Very useful when facing abstract programs! Hence, they are
important in this course since some paradigms have high "expression
power".

Here I use the colon ':' to denote the typing relation. 

*** Some examples:

0 : Int
1 : Int
'c' : Char
"hello" : String
(1/2) : Rational

*** Paramerisation of programs / Abstraction / Function types

Take a simple value like this:

    greetMe = "Hello, Jean-Philippe! How are you today?" 
    greetMe : String


That's very useless as a program! We want to be able to greet more
than one person, and parametrize (or abstract) over the name of the
person greeted:


greet(name) = "Hello, " ++ name ++ " How are you today?" 


The above makes sense only when 'name' is a string, and in that case
greet(name) is a string. 

name : String    ⊢    "Hello, " ++ name ++ " How are you today?" : String

We can then deduce that "greet" is a function taking a string into a
string, written formally as follows:

greet : String -> String

*** Trivia: types of the following
- factorial : ?  
- π : ?  
- sin : ?
- × : ?
- derivative : ? (or ∫ : ?) (answer this question after FP paradigm...)

* Imperative programming
** Paradigm

1. do this
2. then do that
3. then do some otherthing 
4. if not done, then repeat 2. and 3. 

(cf. cookbook...
   ... for beginner cooks :)

*** Computing model
"von neumann" model of the computer:

- Memory cells
- Program (assignments, arithmetic, logic, (conditional) jumps)

** Example

*** Gotos

   -- Assume A : list of sortable items

   begin:
        swapped = false
        i := 1;
   loop:
        if A[i-1] <= A[i] goto no_swap
        swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
        swapped = true
   no_swap:
        i := i+1
        if i < n then goto loop
        if swapped goto begin

*** Loops & Ifs

   -- Assume A : list of sortable items

      while swapped
        swapped = false
        for each i in 1 to length(A) - 1 inclusive do:
          if A[i-1] > A[i] then
            swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
            swapped = true
          end if
        end for

*** Wrapping in a procedure for good measure

    procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
      do
        swapped = false
        for each i in 1 to length(A) - 1 inclusive do:
          if A[i-1] > A[i] then
            swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
            swapped = true
          end if
        end for
      while swapped
    end procedure

** Discussion: When are gotos appropriate?

*** Exercise: switch/case

** Reverse transformation?

No general form! (You must be creative)

** Transformation: inlining procedures
*** Source

  x := x + y

procedure f(x,y)
  g(x,y)
  x := x + 1
  g(y,x)

f(a,b)

*** Intermediate

procedure f(x,y)
  x := x + y
  x := x + 1
  y := y + x


f(a,b)

*** Final

a := a + b
a := a + 1
b := b + x

*** Question: What happens when the original program is recursive?
** Transformation: Procedures -> Gotos & Variables

--------------------------------------
function sqrt(x : Float) : Float
  result := x / 2 
  while ...
    -- Newton approx to refine the result
  return result;

-- the calls:
sqrt(12345)
...
...
sqrt(6789);

------------------------------------


----------------------------------
sqrt:
-- argument in global variable 'sqrtArgument'
sqrtResult := sqrtArgument / 2;
-- And then newton algorithm 
...
...
-- at this point, sqrtResult contains the result.
goto sqrtCaller;


sqrtArgument := 12345;
sqrtCaller := out1;
goto sqrt;
out1:
...
...
sqrtArgument := 6789;
sqrtCaller := out1;
goto sqrt;
out1:
---------------------------------------

*** Trivia: What happens when the original program is recursive?

- Loop (dynamic)
- variables: a mess...
** Transformation: Explicit stack
*** 1st example: factorial.
Translation of a recursive call:
 - push local variables on a stack
 - set caller
 - goto
 - pop local variables

-----------------------------------
function fact (n:Int)
  if n = 0 then
    return 1
  else
    return n * fact(n-1)
-----------------------------------

Straightforward application of rules:

---------------------------------------
-- Call to 'fact'
caller := out;
n := 12;
goto fact;
out:

...
...

-- Definition of 'fact':
fact:
if n = 0 then
  result := 1;
  goto caller;
else 
  push(n,caller);         -- save locals         \
  caller := continue;     -- remember caller      |
  n := n-1;               -- set arguments        |    This is the translation
  goto fact;              -- jump                 |        of the call  'fact(n-1)'
continue:                                         |
  pop(n,caller);          -- restore locals       /
  result := n * result;   -- result (on the rhs of :=) is the result of the recursive call.
  goto caller;            
------------------------------------------------

*** 2nd example: factorial (alternative algorithm)
**** Source
--------------------------------
function fact (n:Int,acc:Int)
  if n = 0 then
    return acc
  else
    return fact(n-1,n * acc)
--------------------------------

**** Question: explain the algorithm.

**** Target (by straightforward application of rules)
--------------------------------
fact: -- n,acc,caller are defined here.
if n = 0 then
  result := acc;
  goto caller;
else
  push (n,acc,caller)
  acc := acc * n;
  n := n-1;
  caller := continue;
  goto fact;  
  continue:
  pop (n,acc,caller)
  result := result; -- just forward the result of the recursive call.
  goto caller;
--------------------------------

**** Improvement:
But:
 - The local variables are saved for nothing: they are not used after they are popped!
 - The result := result statement is useless.

Hence we obtain:


--------------------------------
fact: -- n,acc,caller are defined here.
if n = 0 then
  result := acc;
  goto caller;
else
  push (caller)
  acc := acc * n;
  n := n-1;
  caller := continue;
  goto fact;  
  continue:
  pop (caller)
  goto caller;
--------------------------------

What is the effect of the following?

  push (caller)
  caller := continue
  goto fact

It fact, it is the same as 

  goto fact

Indeed, after returning to "continue", the caller will just be popped
from the stack; and we'll jump to it.  This would also be done by the
normal "goto caller" return statement if we had not overwritten the
caller with continue.


Hence, the stack can be removed altogether! This is called /tail-call optimisation/. Why?


We get:
-----------------
acc := 1;
caller := out;
goto fact
out:

fact:
if n = 0 then
  result := acc;
  goto caller;
else
  acc := n * acc; -- note the order of assignments
  n := n-1;
  goto fact:
-----------------

**** Final version
Finally we can reconstruct a loop:


-------------------------
acc := 1;
while n /= 0 do
  acc := n * acc;
  n := n-1;
result := acc;
-------------------------

**** Exercise 
- Derecursify tree traversal (⋆⋆)
- Do you really need a stack? (⋆⋆⋆) (hint: you can update the tree as you go)

** Passing by reference 
*** Reminder: References (aka. pointers)
**** Addresses
Assume:

 x : Integer

Then

 addressOf(x) : PointerTo Integer
   ≃ where in the memory is the variable x

addressOf : Integer -> PointerTo Integer

**** "De-reference"

Assume:

 p : PointerTo Integer

Then:

 variableAt(p) : Integer

------------------------------------
variableAt : PointerTo Integer -> Integer 

**** Trivia: whats the meaning of addressOf(addressOf(x))?
 -> none! because addressOf(x) is just a value, there is no location for it in the memory.
**** Exercise (⋆): re-write the above in C syntax
*** Example
**** Source:

(Supposing the language supports passing arguments by reference:)

increment(by ref. x : Int)
  x := x + 1
...

increment(y)

**** Target

(Assuming the language supports pointers:)

increment(x : PointerTo Int)
  variableAt(x) := variableAt(x) + 1

...

increment(addressOf(y))
*** Exercise (⋆): bubbleSort
*** Question: Why is passing by reference useful?
- "expressive power" : you can factor out parts of the computation that update any (sub-part of) the state
- save time : no need to copy around things

*** Exercise: Does Java use call by reference? 
  Show example(s) that says yes/no
  
* Interlude: Garbage Collection
aka. Automatic memory management
The memory is freed automatically for you! (Magic!?)

- Allows for much easier OOP
- Practically impossible to do FP/Logic without it
* Object-oriented programming
** Coupling data and related code
*** Toy example: Date

class Date

  field
    year : Integer
    month : Integer
    day : Integer


  method ShiftByDays(days : Integer);

  constructor ymd(y,m,d : Integer)
  constructor today -- -- query OS for current date


-- Example use:
appointment = today;
appointment.shiftByDays(7);

**** Note: Objects are, almost invariably, passed by reference.

**** Tranlated into plain records + procedures

record Date
  Year : Integer
  Month : Integer
  Day : Integer
  

function today : Date;

procedure ShiftByDays(this : Date by reference; days : Integer);
-- Why is "by reference" important?
  

-- Example use:
appointment = today;
shiftByDays(appointment,7);

** Encapsulation 

mechanisms to make the fields private

*** Paradigm Shift: Abstract Data Type (ADT) 
 - Example: "stack", "priority queue", ... from your data structures course
 - Every piece data type comes with a specification
 - ... maybe in the form of _unit tests_
 - Notion of data-invariant
 - Advantage: it's easy to change representation of data

 - Note: not every piece of data fits the ADT model. 
   Example: "Person" record.
 - Dogma: never any direct field access (cf. "set" and "get")

** Inheritance
*** Toy example:

class Animal
  method Pet
     print "Undefined"

class Dog inherits Canis
  method Pet
     print "Shake tail"

class Cat inherits Canis 
  method Pet
     print "Mew"


procedure Test(c : Canis)
  c.Feed

Test(new Dog);
Test(new Cat);

*** Transformation: embed method pointers

The above example gets translated as follows:

record Animal
  field
    Pet : function pointer;


record Dog 
  field
    Pet : function pointer;

procedure petDog(this : Dog);
  print "Shake tail"  -- (1)


function createDog : Dog
  return new Dog(pet = petDog);  
    

record Cat
  field 
     Pet : function pointer;

procedure petCat(this : Cat);
  print "Shake tail"


function createCat : Cat
  return new Cat(pet = petCat);  


procedure Test(c : Animal by reference)
  c.Pet; -- (1)


Test(cast<Animal> createDog); -- (2)
Test(cast<Animal> createCat); -- (2)

**** Question: what happens on line (1)

- 'c.Pet' is a function pointer;
- the function stored in that variable is called.
- if c.Pet has been correctly set, either dog/cat case will be called.

**** Question: why are the casts (2) valid?
The layout of the parent class is exactly the same as that of the subclass.
(In general, there can be more fields/methods in the subclass, found _after_ the fields of the top class)
 
**** TODO Liskov substitution principle

 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle is badly written)

*** Exercise: add a StrayCat subclass which: 
- scratches instead of meowing;
- counts of the number of wounds inflicted.
- and apply the transformation

*** TODO Exercise (⋆⋆): what happens when functions have arguments:
(Needs the notion of type, which is found later)
(contra-variance)

*** TODO Extension: function tables

- Is the 'pet' function pointer ever modified?
- How can we save space if there are many methods per class? 

-> One more indirection!

*** Paradigm Shift

  - Multiple "cases" can be implemented by inheriting a common class
  - Dogma: no "if".
  - Specific behaviour is implemented in derived methods
  
  - Open question: multiple dispatch!

** Reading/Exercise: Javascript prototypes
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_syntax#Objects

** TODO multiple-inheritance & interfaces
** Forward reference: ``objects are poor man's [[closures]]''
 Note the similarity between objects and closures: they are both
 encoded as state/environment + fct. pointer.
* Functional programming
** Reading (as necessary): "Learn you a Haskell, for great good!"
http://learnyouahaskell.com/

** A bit of syntax

*** Function definitions

minimum (x,y) = if x < y 
                  then x
                  else y

*** (λ) abstractions / local functions

In the literature:

minimum = λ(x,y). if x < y 
                      then x
                      else y


In Haskell:

minimum = \(x,y) -> if x < y 
                      then x
                      else y



*** Application BINDS TO THE LEFT.

f x   ==  f(x)

f x y == (f x) y  ==  (f(x))(y)

** Algebraic Data
   
If A and B are data types, then...

what is  A + B ?

         similar to union in C (what is the difference?)

         A × B ?

         similar to records in C


Let's count the number of inhabitants of the type:


    #(A + B) = #A + #B
    #(A × B) = #A × #B

To "bootstrap" we also need types 0 (empty type, unit of +) and 1 (singleton, unit of ×)

*** Exercise (⋆⋆⋆): what is A → B, algebraically ?

*** Examples

Bool = 1 + 1

Giving a name to the cases:

Bool = (True : 1) + (False : 1)

In Haskell syntax:

data Bool = True | False

Lists can be defined as follows, using _recursion_:
List a = (Nil : a) + (Cons : a × List a)


Haskell syntax:

data List a = Nil a | Cons a (List a)


Lists as a

*** Exercise: define an algebraic type for binary trees

*** Transformation: Algebraic data type -> inheritance

** Higher-order functions

*** Example: fold/reduce

-- sum the elements in a list
sum Nil          = 0
sum (Cons x xs)  = x + sum xs


-- multiply the elements in a list
product Nil         = 1
product (Cons x xs) = 1 * product xs


ABSTRACT! ABSTRACT! ABSTRACT! (Parameterize)


foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

A function taking another function in parameter: a higher order function.

*** TODO Example: map

*** Exercise: write a function that does the dot-product of a vector; then Abstract.

What do you get?    

*** Reading: (1st part compulsory)
"Can Programming Be Liberated From the von Neumann Style?", John
Backus, 1977 Turing Award Lecture
http://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf

** Removing Higher-Order functions
*** Transformation: Inlining higher-order functions

Example/Exercise: from "filter/map" to for loop...



inverse of abstraction

map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f xs = case xs of 
   [] ->  []
   (x:xs) -> f x : map f xs


multiply n xs = map (\x -> x * n) xs


replace 'f' by its value in the code of 'map':


multiply n xs = case xs of
    [] ->  []
    (x:xs) -> (\x -> x * n) x : recursiveCall f xs


β-reduce:

multiply n xs = case xs of
    [] ->  []
    (x:xs) -> x * n : recursiveCall f xs


Downside: 
- explosion of the code size
- maybe impossible! (eg. the code of map is not available -- map itself is abstract)

*** Transformation: Defunctionalisation (explicit closures)
# <<closures>>
**** Example

map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs


multiply n = map (\x -> x * n) 


map : Closure -> List a -> List b
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = apply f x : map f xs


multiply n = map (Multiply n)

apply (Multiply n) x = x * n

data Closure = Multiply Int | ...

**** Read: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)


**** Exercise: Implement the above example C. 
Hint: Instead of a 'tag', use a function pointer.

....

Note the similarity with [[objects]]!

**** Exercise: Implement the above example Java
Hint: Instead of a tag, make a derived class ('apply' is a method)

** Transformation: Explicit State

Idea: pass around the "state of the world" explicitly

print : () -- in an imperative language, the state is implicit

print : State -> State × () -- after making the state explicit



Assuming the "state of the world" is only the contents of the output
file, then print does what?

Exercise: implement "safePrint" functionally...

procedure safePrint(line) : ErrorCode
  if outOfInk then
    return -1
  else
    print(line)

... given the imperative function

outOfInk : Bool

 1. What is the type of outOfInk in the functional representation ?
 2. What is the translation ?

*** Imperative syntax in Haskell

-- "IP a": type of imperative programs returning a value of type a.
type IP a = State -> State × a

Generic way to sequence two "IP a":

andThen : IP a -> IP b -> IP b
f `andThen` g = \s0 -> let (s1,a) = f s0
                           (s2,b) = g s1
                       in  (s2,b)


But what if the 2nd program uses the returned value of the 1st?
Then (in general) the 2nd program must depend on 'a':

andThen : IP a -> (a -> IP b) -> IP b
f `andThen` g = \s0 -> let (s1,a) = f s0
                           (s2,b) = g a s1
                       in  (s2,b)

If you _can_ define a function with the above type, then Haskell gives
you special syntax for imperative programming. If you give:

instance Monad IP where
  (>>=) = andThen
  return x = -- when x does not depend on the state:


Then the following is valid:


safePrint line = do
  condition <- outOfInk  
  if outOfInk 
    then return -1
    else do print line
            return 0
            
In fact, the meaning of "imperative" is given by that function -- andThen in our case:

safePrint line = 
  outOfInk `andThen` \condition ->
  if outOfInk 
    then return -1
    else print line `andThen` \() ->
         return 0

** Transformation: Currification


f : (A × B) → C
f = ...

g : A → (B → C)
g a = \b -> f (a,b)


h : (A × B) → C
h (a,b) = g a b

*** Note: try to read A → B as B^A
  then what is currification
**** Extra: can you implement other algebraic laws?

** Paradigm shift: HOT!
Higher-Order and Typed
** Purity and its Consequences

Did you know that side effects...
 - are a common source of bugs?
 - make testing difficult?
 - make reasoning difficult?
 - make parallelizing diffcult?
 - cause cancer?

*** Referential transparency

    Mathematical function (sin)

     vs. 

    Function in (say) Java (getChar)

*** Testing is MUCH easier

       (no guesswork to know what a function depends on)

*** More optimisations possible (which ones?)
*** Easier concurrency (cf. Erlang)

    x = 0
    x = x+1 |in parallel with| x = x + 1
  
    Value of x ?     

*** Sharing is ALWAYS safe! (see in a moment)

*** Possible to use laziness  (see in a moment)

** Copying and sharing

Example: tree update

** Laziness

*** Question: How much memory is used by map?

- l : List Int
- length l = n
- How much is consumed by:

    map (+1) l

**** Same question, but assume that only the 1st element of the new list is used in the rest of the program

**** Same question, but assume 'l' is no longer used in the rest of the program.

-> Some say: "in Haskell, lists are a _control structure_".

** Paradigm shift: composition of transformations

- When writing a search function, the programmer can ALWAYS (and ONLY)
  return a list of ALL possible results.

- Programs can be understood as 

- Dogma: no side effect (eg. no global state)

*** Trivia: what is the most used lazy language?
- Probably SQL!
- But remember also unix-shell pipes:
  
   cat /etc/password | grep 'group=admin' | head 

*** Read: _Why functional programming matters_, J. Hughes.

** Transformation: explicit thunks

One can have strict structures in haskell like so:
file:Strict.hs

It's possible to recover laziness like this:
file:Lazy.hs

*** Question: What if we want to encode laziness in an imperative language?
- First introduce explicit thunks,
- Then transform them into closures!

* Concurrent programming
** Disclaimer: Concurrent programming ≠ Parallel programming

Parallel programming = expose (lack of) dependencies between parts of
the computation, so that the computer can run subtasks in parallel.

Concurrent programming = spawn independent processes, which live
independent lives (dependencies might come, but "after the fact").

In summary:
- parallelism: SPEED!
- concurrency: distribution, redundancy, ...

** "The world is concurrent!"
"
The world is concurrent
Things in the world don't share data
Things communicate with messages
Things fail                                      <- (the part we will not discuss)
" -- Joe Armstrong 
     (After his 7th victory in Tour de France)

** Process
A process is an independent thread of computation
file:Process.hs
** Channel
A medium for communication between processes.
file:Channel.hs
** Transformation: variable-managing process
file:CSPVariable.hs
** Transformation: explicit continuations
*** What is a continuation?
*** Example
A (trivial) server:
file:Server.hs
Same with explicit continuations:
file:ServerWithContinuations.hs
*** Exercise: make continuations explicit closures
** Closing
There are more models for concurrency than chanels + processes
(eg. revisions)

** TODO Paradigm shift:
* TODO Logic programming
** Syntax
In this lecture I use the Curry syntax. 
(Similar to Haskell, plus a couple extra features)
*** Read (as needed) [[http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki/documentation/tutorial][the Curry tutorial]]

** Interpreter
- Install PAKCS (recommended)
- ... or just use web interface: http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/pakcs/curryinput_c2p.cgi
** Logic: a crash course (⋆⋆⋆⋆)
*** Question: what is a Logic?
- Principles of reasoning
- (Preferrably) sound.

*** Propositions:
- A statement (can be true or false).

(A proposition that can be proved is called a theorem.)

**** Closed propositions:
- "Socrates is a man"
- "John Hughes has a tatto on the sole of his left foot"

**** Open propositions:
- "x is a man"
- "John Hughes has a tatto on x"

(The above statements _may_ be made true for some value of the (meta-)variable x)

*** Principles
**** Example: conjunction

   A        B                   <--- premisses
----------------
      A ∧ B                     <--- conclusion



     A ∧ B
----------------
       A


     A ∧ B
----------------
       B

**** Example: specialisation
      ∀x. A(x) ⇒ B(x)          A(a)
----------------------------------------
           B(a)


Famously:

   ∀x. Man(x) ⇒ Mortal(x)          Man(socrates)
 ------------------------------------------------
                   Mortal(socrates)

**** Example(⋆⋆⋆): application


   ∀x:A ⇒ B(x)          a:A
----------------------------
           B(a)


Famously:

   ∀x:Man ⇒ Mortal(x)          socrates : Man
 ------------------------------------------------
                   Mortal(socrates)

*** Proof

derive a theorem from a number of axioms, using the principles.


   axiom1   axiom4                              axiom2
 --------------------- principle           -------------- principle ...
   quux                                         foo
  ----------------------------------------------------------- principle ....
                        bar

*** Example: family tree

file:Family.curry


** Unification
** Search

*** List of successes
*** Backtracking
manual search       <-->  constraints

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2280021/logic-variables-support-for-net


Performance of inverted functions can be terrible.

** TODO Paradigm shift:

Defines predicates instead of functions
– Y = f(X) is replaced by f(X,Y)
– X known => Y is computed (f(X))
– Y known => X is computer (f-1(Y))
– Compute both directions with one piece of code


Dogma: No more function!

– Very cool!!!! (parser/pretty-printer,
compiler/decompiler...)
– Sadly, often very inefficient

*** Logic programming:
- Provide a number of facts (axioms/rules)
- Let the computer search for a proof 

* Outlook

The following graph is an overview of all the transformations seen in
the course.

(NOTE: You should know also how to "revert" a transformation!)
