Exercise 104 What is the result of the following unifications? Try to come
up with the result without using the prolog/curry interpreter!
Prolog


a(X,Y) = a(b,c)
X = b
Y = c

a(X,Y) = a(Z,Z)
Z = X = Y

a(X,X) = a(b,c)

X = b = c
no


e(X) = a(b,b)
no

d(X,X,Y) = d(Z,W,W)
X = W = Y


a(X,X) = d(Z,W,W)
no
