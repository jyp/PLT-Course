covered in the two previous lectures. Remember to re-fetch the
file:All.pdf file each week: exercises may have been updated.

| IP 1 | Had time to discuss Procedures → Gotos in addition of the above.                  |
| OO 1 | Had time to do the quick review of Haskell syntax                                 |
| FP 1 | Discussed also HOF and currification                                              |
| FP 2 | Did exercise on: co/contra variance. Showed how to arrive to the [[FP2-Extras2.hs][sieve algorithm]]. |

*** TODO Review
    
** Re-Examination
  SCHEDULED:  <2012-08-30 Thu 14:00>

** Course evaluation
Representatives:

  + oscar.dragen (at gmail)
  + Davor Pejic (pejic at student...)
  + Johannes Weschke (johwesc at student...)

*** Evaluation Meeting 1
    Could not be implemented due to the absence of the representatives
     at the teaching events.  Representatives should then take care
     themselves to advertise themselves to their fellow students.
*** Spontaneous remarks by students on exercise sessions.
- Extra points should be awarded only for planned exercises.
- Students have proposed that instead of them explaining their
  solution directly on the board, they'd prefer the following process.
  (14 people support the proposal out of 35 present at the lecture.)

  - Before the session students turn-in a solution on paper
  - The T.A. explain "the" solution
  - A random student is then picked to explain the differences with
    their solution
  - Students are (still) awarded points in proportion to what they
    submit.
  - The T.A. can use the paper copy to check if what the student says
    corresponds to what they have written.

*** Evaluation Meeting 2
(Oscar was absent from the meeting)
Items:
**** Changes in the course since last year.
- Moved from Master (served as a common ground in programming for
  students with various backgrounds -- the course was given to many
  international students)
- To Bachelor (most students had basic course in FP, OO, ...); the
  focus of the course is now to explain the links between the
  paradigms, and explain new concepts by translation into known (old)
  concepts.
**** Study climate
+ Communication
  - Students feel intimidated by T.A.; it requires courage to go to the
    TA and get one's exercise corrected.
  - Student appreciate the presence of a TA which talks at their own
    level. (So Friday's QA sessions are good.)
+ Workload
   - No complaint.
+ Supervision
  - The 2nd session was already better compared to the 1st.
  - To make the exercise session smoother, the TA will now check the
    solution on paper before the student explains the exercise orally.
  - Instead of "regular" lectures, students appreciate tutorials.
  - Sometimes exercises can be vague. TAs are asked to improve them in
    that respect.  Note however that clarifications can be requested
    (email, office hours).
**** Problematic course items; can resources be used better?
No gap is felt. Various activites reply to existing needs.
**** Course-specific questions in questionnaire; other material for final meeting?
- Do you think the format of the (last few) exercise sessions is
  appropriate?

  1. Inappropriate
  2. It's basically ok but there are aspects to improve (please give details below)
  3. Appropriate
 

- Did the knowledge/skills learnt thanks to the exercises proposed
  helped you accomplish the course goals?

  1. I learnt almost nothing via exercises
  2. I learnt mostly via other sources
  3. I learnt mostly via exercises
  4. My learning was completely driven by the exercises



*** TODO Evaluation Meeting 3   

** TODO Next year:
- Change file structure:
  + Top level (Intro, organisation info, team, exam, course eval, ...)
    + Lecture notes
    + Schedule
    + Exercises
