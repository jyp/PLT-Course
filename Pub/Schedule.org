Note: the contents of each exercise session is about the topics
covered in the two previous lectures. Numbers refer to those in
file:All.pdf. Remember to re-fetch the file each week: exercises may
have been updated.

| IP 1 | Had time to discuss Procedures → Gotos in addition of the above. |
| OO 1 | Had time to do the quick review of Haskell syntax                |

* Other events:
** CHARM
  SCHEDULED: <2012-02-07 Tue>--<2012-02-08 Wed>
  Note that the exercises remain.
** Examination
  SCHEDULED:  <2012-03-09 Fri 14:00>
*** Correction
  SCHEDULED:  <2012-03-13 Tue 14:00>--<2012-03-14 Wed 14:00>
*** TODO Review
    
** Re-Examination
  SCHEDULED:  <2012-08-30 Thu 14:00>

** Course evaluation
Representatives:

  + oscar.dragen (at gmail)
  + Davor Pejic (pejic at student...)
  + Johannes Weschke (johwesc at student...)

*** Evaluation Meeting 1
    Could not be implemented due to the absence of the representatives
     at the teaching events.  Representatives should then take care
     themselves to advertise themselves to their fellow students.
*** Spontaneous remarks by students on exercise sessions.
- Extra points should be awarded only for planned exercises.
- Students have proposed that instead of them explaining their
  solution directly on the board, they'd prefer the following process.
  (14 people support the proposal out of 35 present at the lecture.)

  - Before the session students turn-in a solution on paper
  - The T.A. explain "the" solution
  - A random student is then picked to explain the differences with
    their solution
  - Students are (still) awarded points in proportion to what they
    submit.
  - The T.A. can use the paper copy to check if what the student says
    corresponds to what they have written.

*** TODO Evaluation Meeting 2
Items:
**** Changes in the course since last year.
**** Study climate (communication, work load, supervision).
**** Problematic course items; can resources be used better?
**** Course-specific questions in questionnaire; other material for final meeting?
*** TODO Evaluation Meeting 3
